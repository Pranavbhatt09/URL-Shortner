# URL-Shortner for the intership by using flask (a python framework)+ basic html


Short URL Generator
This code provides a web application for generating short URLs. It uses a Flask framework to handle HTTP requests and responses. When a user submits a long URL through the web interface, the code generates a unique short URL and stores it in a dictionary along with the corresponding long URL. The short URL is then returned to the user, and when accessed, it redirects to the original long URL.



Usage
Open the application in your web browser.

Enter a long URL that you want to shorten in the input field.

Click the "Shorten URL" button.

The application will generate a unique short URL for your long URL.

Copy and share the short URL as needed.

When someone accesses the short URL, they will be redirected to the original long URL.
